# 2D-Platform
## Unity Version
Unity 2020.1.6f1
<br></br>
## 说明
这是我之前自己随意写的一个项目。里面还有很多没有修复的非恶性Bug和一些完全可以优化的更好的代码。不过碍于时间和精力，不打算修复了。
## 初衷
之前做这个项目的初衷主要是，玩了很多国产的平台跳跃游戏，但是手感好的很少，我就不明白为什么，难道好的手感那么难做吗，所以我想自己试试看能不能做一个好的手感的平台跳跃游戏，最终的成品的效果我是比较满意的，但是代码写的我很不满意。当时花了四天左右写出来，然后给朋友们测试，修复一些恶性Bug又花了4天左右。代码其实采用状态机而不是一堆的bool来写会更好一些。
## 为什么开源
把这个开源出来主要是我之前做的教程有不少人催更，但是我又没有时间出教程了，所以出此下策，开源出来。我觉得这是很不负责任的表现，所以过几个月有时间了我会看看能否把这个教程给做完。

## Description
This is a project I wrote at random before. There are many bugs that would not affect gameplay that have not been fixed and some code that could be better. But due to time and energy, I don't plan to fix those problems. 
## Original intention
The original intention of doing this project before was mainly to play a lot of platform games made by some indie game developer in China, but there are very few games that has good jumping feelings. I wonder why. Is it so difficult to make a good feeling games? So, I want to try to make one by myself. At the end, I am quite satisfied with the effect of the platform jumping feelings but not with the code. This project took me about 4 days to do it, and then to test it with friends, it tooks me another 4 days to fix some serious bugs. The code of MainController could be actually better if I use a finite-state machine instead of a bunch of bool. 
## Why open source
I made this open source mainly because many people urged me to update the tutorials I did before, but I didn't have time to publish the tutorials, so I decided to open it up. I think this is a very irresponsible performance, so I will see if I can finish this tutorial in a few months. (Also the tutorials is in Chinese, sry about that)
